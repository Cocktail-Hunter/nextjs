# Cocktail Hunter

Find cocktails you can make based on your inventory.

### Context

People sometimes don't have a wide variety of alcohol in their homes and might not want to go all the way to the store for that one mysterious ingredient.

### This is where this app comes in...

Users will be able to input a list of all the alcohol and ingredients they've got and the app will return all possible cocktails the user can make. By default, it will result with cocktails strictly with the ingredients the user has but it can be toggled off where the app can result with cocktails with 1-2 missing ingredients.

# Long term plans

Users are able to publish their own cocktail recipes that they've discovered or want to share with the community.
